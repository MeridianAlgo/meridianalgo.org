Stocks historically deliver the highest long-term growth but can swing sharply in the short term. Blue-chip companies behave differently from small-cap innovators, so evaluating business fundamentals matters."

Bonds generally move opposite to stocks, cushioning your portfolio during market downturns. Credit quality, duration, and interest rates influence bond performance."
