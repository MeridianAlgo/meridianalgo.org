Understanding how these plans work and how to maximize their benefits can save tens of thousands of dollars over time.",

        "title": "Understanding 529 Plans",
        "content": "A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged investment account designed to encourage saving for future education costs. Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, these plans are sponsored by states, state agencies, or educational institutions. There are two types: savings plans (investment accounts) and prepaid tuition plans (lock in current tuition rates). Most people use savings plans, which work similarly to 401(k)s or IRAs—you contribute money, choose investments, and the account grows tax-free. Withdrawals are tax-free when used for qualified education expenses including tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, and up to $10,000 per year for K-12 tuition."

        "title": "Tax Benefits and Advantages",
        "content": "529 plans offer triple tax advantages in many states: contributions may be tax-deductible at the state level (over 30 states offer this), the money grows tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free at both federal and state levels. While there's no federal tax deduction for contributions, the tax-free growth is powerful—over 18 years, this can save thousands compared to a taxable account. Some states offer additional benefits like matching grants or scholarships for 529 account holders. Grandparents and other relatives can contribute to a child's 529 plan, and these contributions may qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion ($18,000 per person in 2024, or $36,000 for married couples)."

      {
        "title": "Investment Options and Strategies",
        "content": "Most 529 plans offer age-based portfolios that automatically become more conservative as the beneficiary approaches college age, similar to target-date retirement funds. When your child is young, the portfolio is aggressive (more stocks); as college nears, it shifts to bonds and cash to protect gains. You can also choose static portfolios if you prefer to manage the allocation yourself. Investment options typically include mutual funds or ETFs covering various asset classes. You can change your investment allocation twice per year or when changing beneficiaries. Compare plans based on fees—lower expense ratios mean more money for education. You're not limited to your state's plan, though using your state's plan may offer tax benefits."

        "title": "Contribution Strategies",
        "content": "Start early—even small contributions grow significantly over time thanks to compound interest. Contributing $200/month from birth to age 18 at 7% annual return yields about $90,000. Many families use gift occasions (birthdays, holidays) to request 529 contributions instead of toys. Consider front-loading contributions if you have a lump sum—you can contribute up to five years' worth of annual gift tax exclusions at once ($90,000 per person or $180,000 per couple in 2024) without gift tax implications. Automate contributions to make saving consistent. If grandparents are contributing, coordinate timing—their contributions can affect financial aid calculations differently than parent-owned accounts."

        "title": "Qualified Expenses and Withdrawals",
        "content": "Qualified higher education expenses include tuition, mandatory fees, books, supplies, equipment required for enrollment, and room and board (up to the school's cost of attendance). Computer equipment and internet access are also qualified. For K-12, up to $10,000 per year per student can be withdrawn tax-free for tuition. You can also use up to $10,000 lifetime to pay student loans. Non-qualified withdrawals incur income tax on earnings plus a 10% penalty, though the penalty is waived in certain circumstances (scholarship, death, disability, or attendance at a U.S. military academy). Keep receipts and documentation for all withdrawals."

        "title": "What If Plans Change?",
        "content": "529 plans offer flexibility if your child doesn't attend college or receives a scholarship. You can change the beneficiary to another family member (sibling, cousin, parent, or even yourself) without penalty. If the beneficiary receives a scholarship, you can withdraw up to the scholarship amount without the 10% penalty (though you'll still pay income tax on earnings). Starting in 2024, unused 529 funds can be rolled over to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary (up to $35,000 lifetime, subject to annual Roth contribution limits and other restrictions). The account must have been open for at least 15 years for this option."

Consider having grandparents wait until after filing the final FAFSA (junior year of college) to make distributions, or transfer ownership to the parent."
