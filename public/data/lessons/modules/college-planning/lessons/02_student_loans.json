Understanding the different types of loans, how interest works, and smart borrowing strategies can save you tens of thousands of dollars and years of repayment.",

        "title": "Federal vs. Private Student Loans",
        "content": "Federal student loans are funded by the government and offer significant advantages: fixed interest rates, income-driven repayment options, deferment and forbearance options, and potential loan forgiveness programs. They don't require credit checks (except Parent PLUS loans) or cosigners. Private student loans are offered by banks, credit unions, and online lenders. They typically require credit checks, may have variable interest rates, offer fewer repayment options, and rarely qualify for forgiveness programs. Always exhaust federal loan options before considering private loans. Federal loans include Direct Subsidized Loans (for undergrads with financial need), Direct Unsubsidized Loans (for all students), Direct PLUS Loans (for graduate students and parents), and Direct Consolidation Loans."
      },
      {
        "title": "Interest Rates and How They Work",
        "content": "Federal student loan interest rates are set by Congress and fixed for the life of the loan. For 2023-24, undergraduate Direct Loans are at 5.50%, graduate unsubsidized loans at 7.05%, and PLUS loans at 8.05%. Interest accrues daily based on your outstanding principal balance. For subsidized loans, the government pays interest while you're in school at least half-time, during the grace period, and during deferment. For unsubsidized and private loans, interest accrues from disbursement—if you don't pay it, it capitalizes (gets added to principal) when repayment begins, meaning you'll pay interest on interest. Even paying just the interest while in school can save thousands over the loan's life."

        "title": "Borrowing Limits and Smart Borrowing",
        "content": "Federal loans have annual and aggregate limits. Dependent undergraduates can borrow $5,500-$7,500 per year ($31,000 total), while independent students can borrow $9,500-$12,500 per year ($57,500 total). Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 per year ($138,500 total including undergrad). A common rule of thumb: don't borrow more than your expected first-year salary. If you'll earn $50,000, try to keep total student debt under $50,000. This ensures manageable payments (typically 10-15% of income). Consider your major's earning potential realistically. Minimize borrowing by: working part-time, attending community college first, living at home, applying for scholarships, and choosing affordable schools."

        "title": "Repayment Plans and Options",
        "content": "Federal loans offer multiple repayment plans. Standard Repayment: fixed payments over 10 years (highest monthly payment, lowest total interest). Graduated Repayment: payments start low and increase every two years over 10 years. Extended Repayment: lower payments over 25 years (available if you owe $30,000+). Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans: payments based on income and family size, with forgiveness after 20-25 years. IDR plans include Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE), and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). The new SAVE plan (replacing REPAYE) offers the most generous terms, with payments as low as 5% of discretionary income for undergrad loans."

        "title": "Loan Forgiveness Programs",
        "content": "Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) forgives remaining federal loan balance after 120 qualifying monthly payments while working full-time for a qualifying employer (government or nonprofit). Teacher Loan Forgiveness offers up to $17,500 for teachers in low-income schools after five years. Income-driven repayment plans forgive remaining balances after 20-25 years of payments (though forgiven amounts may be taxable). Borrower Defense to Repayment can discharge loans if your school defrauded you or violated certain laws. Total and Permanent Disability Discharge eliminates loans if you become disabled. Each program has specific requirements—research carefully and maintain proper documentation."

        "title": "Refinancing and Consolidation",
        "content": "Federal Direct Consolidation combines multiple federal loans into one with a weighted average interest rate (rounded up to nearest 1/8%). This doesn't save money but simplifies repayment and can make you eligible for certain repayment plans or forgiveness programs. Private refinancing replaces federal or private loans with a new private loan, potentially at a lower interest rate. This can save money if you have good credit and income, but you lose all federal benefits: income-driven repayment, forgiveness programs, and flexible deferment options. Only refinance federal loans if you're certain you won't need these protections and can get a significantly lower rate. Never refinance if pursuing PSLF or other forgiveness programs."

Parents are fully responsible for repayment, and these loans can jeopardize retirement savings. Consider whether the student should attend a less expensive school rather than parents taking on significant debt."

      "question": "What is the key difference between subsidized and unsubsidized federal student loans?",
      "options": [
        "Subsidized loans have lower interest rates",
        "The government pays interest on subsidized loans while you're in school",

        "Unsubsidized loans are only for graduate students"

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For subsidized federal loans, the government pays the interest while you're enrolled at least half-time, during the grace period, and during deferment periods. For unsubsidized loans, interest accrues from the day the loan is disbursed, and you're responsible for all interest."
