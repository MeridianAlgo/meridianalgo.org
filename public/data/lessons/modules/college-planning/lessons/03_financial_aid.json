    "introduction": "Financial aid can dramatically reduce the cost of college, but navigating the system requires understanding the FAFSA, Expected Family Contribution (EFC), and various types of aid. Many families leave money on the table by not completing the FAFSA or missing deadlines. Understanding how financial aid works and how to position yourself for maximum aid can save tens of thousands of dollars.",

        "title": "Understanding the FAFSA",
        "content": "The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the gateway to federal grants, loans, work-study, and most state and institutional aid. It must be completed annually, even if you don't think you'll qualify for need-based aid—some merit scholarships and all federal loans require it. The FAFSA uses your family's financial information from two years prior (called 'prior-prior year'), so your 2024-25 FAFSA uses 2022 tax data. This allows you to file earlier and use completed tax returns. The application asks about income, assets, household size, and number of family members in college. It takes 30-60 minutes to complete and is entirely free—never pay someone to file it for you."

        "title": "Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and Student Aid Index (SAI)",
        "content": "The FAFSA calculates your Expected Family Contribution (being renamed Student Aid Index starting 2024-25), which represents what your family is expected to contribute toward college costs. This isn't what you'll actually pay—it's used to determine aid eligibility. Your financial need equals Cost of Attendance minus EFC. Lower EFC means more aid eligibility. The formula considers: parent income (assessed at 22-47% above a protection allowance), student income (assessed at 50% above $7,040), parent assets (assessed at 5.64%), and student assets (assessed at 20%). Retirement accounts, home equity, and small family businesses are excluded. Having multiple children in college simultaneously significantly reduces EFC per student."

        "title": "Types of Financial Aid",
        "content": "Grants are need-based aid that doesn't need to be repaid. Federal Pell Grants (up to $7,395 for 2023-24) are for undergraduates with exceptional need. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG) provide additional need-based aid. State grants vary by state—some are substantial. Scholarships are merit-based or need-based awards that don't require repayment, offered by colleges, private organizations, employers, and community groups. Work-study provides part-time jobs for students with financial need, allowing you to earn money for education expenses. Loans must be repaid with interest. The aid package order matters: grants and scholarships first, then work-study, then federal loans, and private loans as a last resort."

      {
        "title": "CSS Profile and Institutional Aid",
        "content": "About 400 colleges (mostly private) require the CSS Profile in addition to FAFSA to award their own institutional aid. The CSS Profile is more detailed than FAFSA and costs $25 for the first school plus $16 per additional school (fee waivers available). It considers factors FAFSA doesn't: home equity, non-custodial parent income, sibling assets, and more detailed asset information. Some schools using CSS Profile are more generous with aid than FAFSA-only schools. Each school has its own deadline, often earlier than FAFSA. Check each college's financial aid website for requirements. Some states also have their own aid applications."

        "title": "Maximizing Your Aid Eligibility",
        "content": "Strategic financial planning can increase aid eligibility. Minimize student assets—money in the student's name is assessed at 20% vs. 5.64% for parent assets. Consider moving student savings to a parent-owned 529 plan. Maximize retirement contributions—these aren't counted as assets. Pay off consumer debt before the FAFSA year—this reduces assets without affecting EFC. Time large financial transactions carefully—selling investments or taking distributions can increase income in the base year. Grandparent-owned 529 plans can reduce aid, so consider transferring ownership to parents or waiting until after filing the final FAFSA to take distributions. If parents are divorced, the custodial parent's income is used for FAFSA (the parent the student lived with most in the past 12 months)."

Check each school's deadline. December-March: Colleges send acceptance letters and financial aid award letters. Compare offers carefully—look at net price (cost minus grants/scholarships), not just total aid. Some packages include more loans than others. April-May: Financial Aid Appeal period. If your circumstances changed or you received a better offer elsewhere, contact the financial aid office to request a review. May 1: National College Decision Day. Accept your offer and submit enrollment deposit. Summer: Complete loan entrance counseling and sign promissory notes. Finalize housing and meal plans. Throughout college: File FAFSA annually, maintain satisfactory academic progress, and reapply for scholarships."

      "question": "How are student assets assessed differently than parent assets for financial aid purposes?",
      "options": [
        "Student assets are assessed at 5.64%, parent assets at 20%",
        "Student assets are assessed at 20%, parent assets at 5.64%",

        "Student assets aren't counted at all"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Student assets are assessed at 20% for financial aid calculations, meaning $1,000 in a student's savings account reduces aid eligibility by $200. Parent assets are assessed at only 5.64%, reducing aid by $56.40 for every $1,000. This is why it's often better to keep college savings in parent-owned accounts or 529 plans."
