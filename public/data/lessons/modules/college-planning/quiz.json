    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is the primary tax advantage of a 529 college savings plan?",
      "options": [
        "Contributions are federally tax-deductible",
        "Earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals for qualified expenses are tax-free",
        "You can withdraw money anytime for any purpose tax-free",
        "The account earns guaranteed returns"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "529 plans offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals when used for qualified education expenses. While some states offer tax deductions for contributions, there is no federal deduction. The tax-free compounding over 18+ years is the primary benefit."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "What happens to unused 529 plan funds if the beneficiary doesn't attend college?",
      "options": [
        "The funds are forfeited to the state",
        "You can change the beneficiary to another family member without penalty",
        "You must pay a 50% penalty on all withdrawals",
        "The account is automatically closed"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "529 plans offer flexibility—you can change the beneficiary to another qualifying family member without penalty. You can also withdraw funds for non-education purposes (paying income tax and a 10% penalty on earnings), or starting in 2024, roll up to $35,000 to a Roth IRA for the beneficiary under certain conditions."

      "question": "What is the key difference between subsidized and unsubsidized federal student loans?",
      "options": [
        "Subsidized loans have lower interest rates",
        "The government pays interest on subsidized loans while you're in school",
        "Subsidized loans never need to be repaid",
        "Unsubsidized loans are only available to graduate students"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "For subsidized federal loans, the government pays the interest while you're enrolled at least half-time, during grace periods, and during deferment. For unsubsidized loans, interest accrues from disbursement, and you're responsible for all interest charges."

    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What is a good rule of thumb for total student loan borrowing?",
      "options": [
        "Borrow as much as you need regardless of future salary",
        "Don't borrow more than your expected first-year salary",
        "Never borrow more than $10,000 total",
        "Borrow twice your expected annual salary"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A common guideline is to keep total student debt below your expected first-year salary. This typically results in manageable monthly payments of 10-15% of income. Borrowing significantly more can lead to financial stress and difficulty making payments."

      "question": "When does the FAFSA open for the following academic year?",
      "options": [
        "January 1",
        "July 1",
        "October 1",
        "December 1"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The FAFSA opens October 1 each year for the following academic year. It's important to file as early as possible because some aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. The FAFSA uses tax information from two years prior, allowing early filing."

      "id": "q6",
      "question": "How are student assets assessed differently than parent assets for financial aid?",
      "options": [
        "Student assets are assessed at 5.64%, parent assets at 20%",
        "Student assets are assessed at 20%, parent assets at 5.64%",
        "Both are assessed equally",
        "Student assets aren't counted"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Student assets are assessed at 20% for financial aid calculations, while parent assets are assessed at only 5.64%. This means money in a student's name has a much larger impact on aid eligibility, which is why it's often better to keep savings in parent-owned accounts or 529 plans."

      ],

      "explanation": "Starting at community college for two years and transferring to a four-year university can save $40,000-$80,000 or more compared to attending a university for all four years. Community college tuition is typically $3,000-$5,000 per year versus $10,000-$50,000+ at universities."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Earning college credits through AP exams ($95 each), CLEP exams ($89 each), or dual enrollment can significantly reduce time to degree. Passing 8 AP exams could save an entire year of college, saving $10,000-$30,000+ in tuition, fees, and living expenses."
