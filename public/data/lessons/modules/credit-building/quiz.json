    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What percentage of your credit score is determined by payment history?",
      "options": [
        "35% - Payment history is the most important factor",
        "30% - Credit utilization matters most",
        "15% - Length of credit history is key",
        "10% - New credit inquiries are most important"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score, making it the single most important factor. Paying bills on time consistently is crucial for building and maintaining good credit."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the recommended credit utilization ratio?",
      "options": [
        "Below 10% for optimal scores",
        "Below 30% is recommended",
        "Below 50% is acceptable",
        "It doesn't matter as long as you pay on time"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Keeping your credit utilization below 30% is recommended for maintaining a good credit score. This means if you have a $1,000 credit limit, try to keep your balance below $300. Lower is even better!"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A secured credit card requires a cash deposit.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. A secured credit card requires a refundable security deposit that typically becomes your credit limit. This makes them easier to get approved for when you're building credit from scratch. After demonstrating responsible use, you can often upgrade to an unsecured card."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How often can you get free credit reports from each bureau?",
      "options": [
        "Once per year from each bureau (3 total per year)",
        "Once per year total (must choose one bureau)",
        "Twice per year from each bureau",
        "Only when you're denied credit"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "You're entitled to one free credit report from each of the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) every 12 months through AnnualCreditReport.com. That's 3 free reports per year! Pro tip: Space them out every 4 months to monitor your credit year-round."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Closing old credit cards always improves your credit score.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "False. Closing old credit cards can actually hurt your score by reducing your available credit (increasing utilization) and shortening your credit history. Keep old cards open and use them occasionally to maintain your credit history length."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What's the best first step when starting to build credit?",
      "options": [
        "Apply for multiple credit cards at once",
        "Get a secured credit card or become an authorized user",
        "Take out a large personal loan",
        "Wait until you have more money saved"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Starting with a secured credit card or becoming an authorized user on someone else's account are the safest, most effective ways to begin building credit. These options are accessible to beginners and help establish positive payment history."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How long does negative information typically stay on your credit report?",
      "options": [
        "1-2 years",
        "3-5 years",
        "7 years for most items",
        "Forever"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Most negative information stays on your credit report for 7 years, including late payments, collections, and charge-offs. Bankruptcies can stay for up to 10 years. The good news is that the impact lessens over time, especially if you build positive credit history."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Checking your own credit score hurts your credit.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "False. Checking your own credit score is a 'soft inquiry' and does NOT hurt your credit. Only 'hard inquiries' from lenders when you apply for credit can temporarily lower your score. Check your credit as often as you want!"
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What should you do if you find an error on your credit report?",

        "Ignore it - errors don't matter",
        "Wait for it to fix itself",
        "Dispute it with the credit bureau in writing",
        "Close all your credit accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If you find an error, dispute it in writing with the credit bureau. They must investigate within 30 days. Include documentation supporting your claim. Errors can significantly impact your score, so it's important to address them promptly."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What's the minimum credit score typically needed for the best mortgage rates?",
      "options": [
        "580-620",
        "640-680",
        "700-720",
        "760-780"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A credit score of 760-780 or higher typically qualifies you for the best mortgage rates. While you can get approved with lower scores, you'll pay higher interest rates. Even a small difference in rate can mean tens of thousands of dollars over a 30-year mortgage."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the 'pay for delete' strategy when dealing with collections?",

        "Paying extra fees to speed up credit report updates"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Pay for delete is a negotiation strategy where you offer to pay a collection debt in full (or settle for less) in exchange for the collector completely removing the negative item from your credit report. Always get this agreement in writing before paying!"
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Making a payment on an old debt can restart the statute of limitations.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. Making a payment or even acknowledging that you owe an old debt can restart the statute of limitations in many states, giving creditors more time to sue you. This is why you should send a debt validation letter first and never admit the debt is yours until you've verified it."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the optimal credit utilization for achieving an 800+ credit score?",
      "options": [
        "Under 30%",
        "Under 20%",
        "Under 10%",
        "Under 5%"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "While under 30% is good, achieving an 800+ credit score typically requires keeping utilization under 5%. This shows exceptional credit management and maximizes your score. Pay down balances before your statement closes to report low utilization."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the AZEO (All Zero Except One) method?",
      "options": [
        "Paying all cards to zero and closing all but one",
        "Letting all cards report $0 balance except one card with 1-5% utilization",
        "Using only one credit card for all purchases",
        "Keeping zero balance on all cards at all times"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "AZEO is an advanced optimization technique where you pay all credit cards to $0 before the statement closes, except one card that reports a small balance (1-5% of total credit limit). This can boost scores 10-30 points for those already in the 750+ range."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Reporting 0% utilization on all credit cards is optimal for your credit score.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "False. While 0% utilization isn't bad, reporting 1-9% utilization is actually better. This shows you're actively using credit responsibly. Reporting 0% on all cards means scoring models can't assess your current credit management behavior."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When should you request a credit limit increase?",
      "options": [
        "Every month to maximize your available credit",
        "Every 6-12 months with perfect payment history",
        "Only when you're denied for a loan",
        "Never - it will hurt your credit score"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Request credit limit increases every 6-12 months if you have perfect payment history. Always ask if they can do it with a soft pull only. Higher limits lower your utilization ratio, which can boost your score 15-30 points without any additional spending."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How long does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy stay on your credit report?",
      "options": [
        "3 years",
        "7 years",
        "10 years",
        "15 years"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years from the filing date. Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays for 7 years. However, the impact on your score decreases over time, especially if you rebuild positive credit history."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card can instantly add years to your credit history.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. When you become an authorized user, the entire payment history of that card is typically added to your credit report. If it's a 20-year-old card with perfect history, you instantly gain 20 years of positive credit history, potentially boosting your score 50-100+ points."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What percentage of Americans have credit scores above 800?",

        "45%",
        "60%"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Only 21% of Americans have credit scores above 800. This elite group enjoys the best interest rates and terms on all credit products, saving tens of thousands of dollars over their lifetime. With the right strategies, you can join this group!"
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What should you do if you're applying for a mortgage in the next 6 months?",
      "options": [
        "Open several new credit cards to increase available credit",
        "Close old unused credit cards to simplify your profile",
        "Freeze all credit optimization efforts and maintain stability",
        "Request credit limit increases on all cards"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "If you're applying for a mortgage soon, freeze all credit optimization efforts. Don't open new accounts, close old ones, or request limit increases. Lenders want to see stability. Make these changes after your mortgage closes."
