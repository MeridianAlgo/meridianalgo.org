It's a carefully constructed mix of companies across different sectors, with varying yields and growth rates, designed to provide reliable and growing income.\n\nThe goal is diversification—not just in number of stocks, but in income sources. If all your dividend stocks are in one sector (like energy), a sector downturn could devastate your income."
