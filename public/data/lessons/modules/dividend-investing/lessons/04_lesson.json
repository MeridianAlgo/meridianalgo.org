      "title": "How Dividend Reinvestment Works",
      "content": "When you reinvest dividends, instead of receiving cash, your dividends automatically purchase additional shares of the same stock or fund.\n\nExample:\n- You own 100 shares of a $50 stock with a 3% yield\n- Annual dividend: $150 (100 shares × $50 × 3%)\n- Reinvested: $150 buys 3 more shares\n- Next year: 103 shares pay $154.50\n- And so on...\n\nOver 30 years, those reinvested dividends can more than double your share count, even without adding new money. Combined with dividend growth, your income can increase 10x or more."

      "content": "Let's see the real impact with numbers:\n\nScenario: $100,000 invested in dividend stocks\n- Starting yield: 3%\n- Dividend growth: 7% annually\n- Stock price growth: 5% annually\n\nWithout Reinvestment (Taking Cash):\n- Year 1 income: $3,000\n- Year 10 income: $5,900\n- Year 20 income: $11,600\n- Year 30 income: $22,800\n- Total dividends received: $290,000\n- Portfolio value: $432,000\n\nWith Reinvestment (DRIP):\n- Year 1 income: $3,000 (reinvested)\n- Year 10 income: $9,200 (reinvested)\n- Year 20 income: $28,500 (reinvested)\n- Year 30 income: $88,000 (if you stopped reinvesting)\n- Portfolio value: $1,450,000\n\nThe difference is staggering. Reinvesting dividends for 30 years turns $100,000 into $1.45 million, with $88,000 in annual income. Taking cash leaves you with $432,000 and $22,800 in income."
