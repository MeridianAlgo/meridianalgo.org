      "content": "Dividends are taxed differently depending on whether they're 'qualified' or 'ordinary':\n\nQualified Dividends: Taxed at favorable long-term capital gains rates (0%, 15%, or 20% depending on income). Most dividends from US companies held for 60+ days qualify.\n\nOrdinary Dividends: Taxed as regular income (up to 37%). Includes dividends from REITs, MLPs, money market funds, and stocks held less than 60 days.\n\nFor most dividend investors, the majority of dividends are qualified and taxed at 15% (for incomes $44,625-$492,300 single / $89,250-$553,850 married in 2024)."

You have a stock with $5,000 in unrealized losses\n3. Sell the losing stock to realize the $5,000 loss\n4. The loss offsets your dividend income\n5. Result: $0 taxable dividend income\n\nRules to Follow:\n- Wash sale rule: Can't buy the same or 'substantially identical' stock within 30 days\n- Can buy a similar (but not identical) ETF immediately\n- Losses exceeding gains can offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income\n- Excess losses carry forward to future years\n\nThis strategy is most valuable in taxable accounts with significant dividend income."
