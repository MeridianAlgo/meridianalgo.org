      "title": "📊 The 7 Critical Factors",
      "content": "When evaluating ETFs, these seven factors determine whether it's a good choice:\n\n1️⃣ Expense Ratio (Most Important):\n\nThis is the annual fee charged by the ETF, expressed as a percentage of your investment.\n\n✅ Excellent: Under 0.10% (10 basis points)\n✅ Good: 0.10-0.25%\n⚠️ Acceptable: 0.25-0.50%\n❌ Avoid: Over 0.50%\n\nExample:\n• Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO): 0.03%\n\n• SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): 0.09%\n\n• Invesco QQQ (QQQ): 0.20%\n\nOn $100,000 invested:\n• VOO costs $30/year\n\n• SPY costs $90/year\n\n• QQQ costs $200/year\n\nOver 30 years, that $60-170 annual difference compounds to $50,000-150,000 in lost returns.\n\n💡 Rule: Never pay more than 0.20% for a broad market index ETF. Specialty ETFs (sector, thematic) can justify 0.30-0.50%, but be selective.\n\n2️⃣ Assets Under Management (AUM):\n\nThis is the total value of all money invested in the ETF.\n\n✅ Excellent: Over $1 billion\n✅ Good: $500 million - $1 billion\n⚠️ Acceptable: $100-500 million\n❌ Avoid: Under $100 million\n\nWhy it matters:\n• Large AUM means the ETF is popular and unlikely to close\n\n• Better liquidity (easier to buy/sell)\n\n• Tighter bid-ask spreads (lower trading costs)\n\n• More stable pricing\n\nSmall ETFs (under $100M) often close within 2-3 years, forcing you to sell and potentially triggering taxes.\n\n3️⃣ Trading Volume:\n\nAverage daily shares traded.\n\n✅ Excellent: Over 1 million shares/day\n✅ Good: 500K - 1 million shares/day\n⚠️ Acceptable: 100K-500K shares/day\n❌ Avoid: Under 100K shares/day\n\nHigh volume means:\n• Easy to buy/sell without moving the price\n\n• Tight bid-ask spreads\n\n• Price tracks NAV closely\n\nLow volume ETFs can have wide spreads (0.50-1.00%), costing you money on every trade.\n\n4️⃣ Bid-Ask Spread:\n\nThe difference between the buying price (ask) and selling price (bid).\n\n✅ Excellent: Under 0.05%\n✅ Good: 0.05-0.10%\n⚠️ Acceptable: 0.10-0.25%\n❌ Avoid: Over 0.25%\n\nExample:\n• Bid: $100.00\n\n• Ask: $100.10\n\n• Spread: $0.10 or 0.10%\n\nIf you buy at $100.10 and immediately sell at $100.00, you lose $0.10 per share. On 100 shares, that's $10 lost to the spread.\n\nFor frequently traded ETFs, this adds up. Always check the spread before buying.\n\n5️⃣ Tracking Error:\n\nHow closely the ETF matches its benchmark index.\n\n✅ Excellent: Under 0.10% annually\n✅ Good: 0.10-0.25%\n⚠️ Acceptable: 0.25-0.50%\n❌ Avoid: Over 0.50%\n\nIf an S&P 500 ETF returns 9.5% when the S&P 500 returned 10%, the tracking error is 0.50%. You're losing 0.50% annually to poor management.\n\nCauses of tracking error:\n• High expense ratio\n\n• Cash drag (holding cash instead of being fully invested)\n\n• Sampling (not holding all index stocks)\n\n• Poor rebalancing\n\nCheck the ETF's historical returns vs its benchmark. Consistent underperformance is a red flag.\n\n6️⃣ Tax Efficiency:\n\nHow often the ETF distributes capital gains.\n\n✅ Excellent: Zero capital gains distributions in past 5 years\n✅ Good: Minimal distributions (under 1% annually)\n⚠️ Acceptable: Occasional distributions\n❌ Avoid: Frequent large distributions\n\nMost broad market ETFs have zero distributions. Actively managed ETFs and sector ETFs may distribute gains.\n\nCheck the ETF's distribution history on the provider's website.\n\n7️⃣ Holdings & Strategy:\n\nWhat does the ETF actually own?\n\n✅ Transparent: Clear, understandable strategy\n✅ Diversified: Holds 50+ securities\n✅ Liquid: Owns stocks that trade easily\n❌ Avoid: Opaque strategies, concentrated bets, illiquid holdings\n\nRead the ETF's prospectus or fact sheet. Understand:\n• What it holds\n\n• How it selects holdings\n\n• How often it rebalances\n\n• Any leverage or derivatives used\n\nIf you can't explain the strategy in one sentence, it's probably too complex."

      "title": "🔍 How to Research ETFs",
      "content": "Follow this step-by-step process to evaluate any ETF:\n\n📱 Step 1: Use ETF Screeners\n\nBest free tools:\n• ETF.com - Most comprehensive database\n\n• ETFdb.com - Great comparison tools\n\n• Morningstar.com - In-depth analysis\n\n• Your broker's research platform\n\nFilter by:\n• Asset class (stocks, bonds, commodities)\n\n• Geography (US, international, emerging markets)\n\n• Sector (technology, healthcare, energy)\n\n• Expense ratio (under 0.20%)\n\n• AUM (over $500M)\n\n📊 Step 2: Compare Similar ETFs\n\nNever buy the first ETF you find. Compare 3-5 similar options:\n\nExample: S&P 500 ETFs\n• VOO (Vanguard): 0.03% expense ratio\n\n• SPY (State Street): 0.09% expense ratio\n\n• IVV (BlackRock): 0.03% expense ratio\n\nAll track the same index, but VOO and IVV are cheaper. SPY has higher volume (better for day traders), but for buy-and-hold, VOO or IVV are better.\n\n📄 Step 3: Read the Fact Sheet\n\nEvery ETF has a fact sheet on the provider's website. Check:\n• Top 10 holdings (what companies/bonds)\n\n• Sector allocation (how much in tech, healthcare, etc.)\n\n• Geographic exposure (US vs international)\n\n• Dividend yield (if any)\n\n• Historical returns (1, 3, 5, 10 years)\n\n• Tracking error vs benchmark\n\n🔎 Step 4: Check the Prospectus\n\nThe legal document explaining the ETF's strategy. Look for:\n• Investment objective (what it's trying to achieve)\n\n• Risks (what could go wrong)\n\n• Fees (expense ratio, trading costs)\n\n• Tax implications\n\nDon't read the whole thing (it's 50+ pages), but skim the summary section.\n\n💬 Step 5: Read Reviews\n\nSearch '[ETF ticker] review' on Google. Read:\n• Morningstar analyst reports\n\n• Seeking Alpha articles\n\n• Reddit r/Bogleheads discussions\n\n• YouTube reviews from credible channels\n\nLook for red flags: high fees, poor tracking, frequent strategy changes, or management issues."
