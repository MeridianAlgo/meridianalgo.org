      "title": "📊 Asset Allocation: The Most Important Decision",
      "content": "Studies show that asset allocation (how you divide your money between stocks, bonds, and other assets) determines 90% of your portfolio's returns. Stock picking and market timing contribute less than 10%.\n\nYour allocation should match:\n• Your age\n\n• Risk tolerance\n\n• Time horizon\n\n• Financial goals\n\n• Income needs\n\n🎯 The Age-Based Rule:\n\nTraditional rule: Bonds = Your Age\n• Age 25: 25% bonds, 75% stocks\n\n• Age 40: 40% bonds, 60% stocks\n\n• Age 65: 65% bonds, 35% stocks\n\nModern rule (longer lifespans): Bonds = Your Age - 20\n• Age 25: 5% bonds, 95% stocks\n\n• Age 40: 20% bonds, 80% stocks\n\n• Age 65: 45% bonds, 55% stocks\n\nThe modern rule accounts for longer retirements and lower bond yields.\n\n💪 Risk Tolerance Test:\n\nImagine your $100,000 portfolio drops to $70,000 in a market crash. Would you:\n\nA) Panic and sell everything → 30% stocks, 70% bonds\nB) Feel anxious but hold → 50% stocks, 50% bonds\nC) Feel uncomfortable but stay invested → 70% stocks, 30% bonds\nD) Buy more at lower prices → 90% stocks, 10% bonds\nE) Not even check your account → 100% stocks\n\nYour answer reveals your true risk tolerance. Be honest—overestimating leads to panic selling at the worst time."

      "content": "Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) means investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions.\n\n🎯 How It Works:\n\nInvest $500/month into your ETF portfolio:\n• When prices are high, you buy fewer shares\n\n• When prices are low, you buy more shares\n\n• Over time, you average out market volatility\n\n📊 Example:\n\nMonth 1: $500 buys 5 shares at $100/share\nMonth 2: $500 buys 6.25 shares at $80/share (market dip)\nMonth 3: $500 buys 4.55 shares at $110/share (market recovery)\n\nTotal: $1,500 invested, 15.8 shares owned\nAverage cost: $94.94/share\nCurrent value (at $110): $1,738\nGain: $238 (15.9%)\n\nIf you'd waited to 'time the market,' you might have missed the dip or bought at the peak.\n\n✅ Benefits of DCA:\n\n• Removes emotion from investing\n\n• Reduces risk of buying at market peaks\n\n• Builds discipline and consistency\n\n• Works automatically (set and forget)\n\n• Proven to beat lump-sum timing attempts\n\n🚀 How to Implement:\n\n1. Set up automatic investments with your broker\n2. Choose your ETFs and allocation\n3. Set the amount ($100, $500, $1000/month)\n4. Pick a date (1st or 15th of month)\n5. Let it run automatically\n6. Rebalance once per year\n\nThis is the strategy used by 90% of successful long-term investors."
