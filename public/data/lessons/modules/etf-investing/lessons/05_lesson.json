      "steps": [
        "Start with a solid core: 70-80% in broad market ETFs (VTI, VXUS, BND). Never compromise your foundation.",
        "Identify your conviction: What sector or theme do you genuinely believe will outperform? Don't chase recent winners.",
        "Research thoroughly: Read the ETF's holdings, strategy, and historical performance. Understand what you're buying.",
        "Start small: Allocate 5% of portfolio to your first sector/thematic ETF. See how it performs and how you react to volatility.",
        "Limit total exposure: Keep all sector/thematic ETFs combined under 20% of portfolio. The rest stays in core holdings.",
        "Set rules: Decide in advance when you'll sell (e.g., if it drops 30%, if the theme changes, after X years).",
        "Rebalance regularly: Don't let a winning sector ETF grow to 30% of your portfolio. Trim winners, add to losers."
