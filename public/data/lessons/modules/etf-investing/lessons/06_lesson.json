      "title": "💰 Tax-Loss Harvesting: Turn Losses into Savings",
      "content": "Tax-loss harvesting means selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill.\n\n🎯 How It Works:\n\nScenario:\n• You own VOO (S&P 500 ETF), bought at $400/share\n\n• Market crashes, now trading at $320/share\n\n• You have a $80/share unrealized loss\n\nStrategy:\n1. Sell VOO at $320 (realize the $80 loss)\n2. Immediately buy a similar ETF (IVV or SPLG - also S&P 500)\n3. You maintain market exposure\n4. You harvest $80/share tax loss\n\n💵 Tax Benefits:\n\n• Losses offset capital gains dollar-for-dollar\n\n• Excess losses offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year\n\n• Remaining losses carry forward indefinitely\n\nExample:\n• You sell 100 shares of VOO: $8,000 loss\n\n• You have $5,000 in capital gains from other investments\n\n• $5,000 loss offsets the gains (save $1,000 in taxes at 20% rate)\n\n• $3,000 loss offsets ordinary income (save $720 at 24% rate)\n\n• Total tax savings: $1,720\n\n⚠️ The Wash Sale Rule:\n\nYou can't buy the \"substantially identical\" security within 30 days before or after the sale.\n\n❌ Wash Sale (Illegal):\n• Sell VOO on Dec 15\n\n• Buy VOO on Dec 20\n\n• Loss is disallowed\n\n✅ Legal Tax-Loss Harvest:\n• Sell VOO on Dec 15\n\n• Buy IVV or SPLG immediately (different ETF, same index)\n\n• Loss is allowed\n\n• After 31 days, you can switch back to VOO if desired\n\n🎯 Best Practices:\n\n• Harvest losses in down markets (2022, 2020, 2018)\n\n• Use similar but not identical ETFs as replacements\n\n• Track your cost basis carefully\n\n• Consider using robo-advisors (Wealthfront, Betterment) that automate this\n\n• Only harvest in taxable accounts (IRAs don't benefit)\n\n💡 Replacement Pairs:\n\nOriginal → Replacement\n• VOO → IVV or SPLG (S&P 500)\n\n• VTI → ITOT or SCHB (Total Market)\n\n• VXUS → IXUS or SCHF (International)\n\n• QQQ → ONEQ (Nasdaq 100)\n\n• VNQ → IYR (Real Estate)\n\nThese track the same indexes but are different enough to avoid wash sales."

      "title": "🎯 Options Strategies with ETFs",
      "content": "Options allow you to generate income or protect your ETF positions. These are advanced strategies—only use if you understand options.\n\n💰 Covered Calls (Income Strategy):\n\nYou own 100 shares of an ETF and sell a call option against it.\n\nExample:\n• Own 100 shares of SPY at $450/share ($45,000 position)\n\n• Sell 1 call option with $460 strike, 30 days out\n\n• Collect $200 premium (income)\n\nOutcomes:\n• SPY stays below $460: Keep shares + $200 premium (0.44% return in 30 days)\n\n• SPY goes above $460: Shares called away at $460, you keep premium\n\nBest for: Sideways or slightly bullish markets. Generates 0.5-1% monthly income.\n\nRisk: Caps your upside at the strike price. If SPY rallies to $500, you only get $460.\n\n🛡️ Protective Puts (Insurance Strategy):\n\nBuy put options to protect against downside.\n\nExample:\n• Own 100 shares of QQQ at $380/share ($38,000 position)\n\n• Buy 1 put option with $360 strike, 90 days out\n\n• Pay $400 premium (insurance cost)\n\nOutcomes:\n• QQQ stays above $360: Put expires worthless, you lose $400 premium\n\n• QQQ drops to $320: Put protects you, limits loss to $2,000 instead of $6,000\n\nBest for: Protecting gains during uncertain times. Like buying insurance.\n\nCost: 1-3% of portfolio value for 3-6 months of protection.\n\n📊 Cash-Secured Puts (Acquisition Strategy):\n\nSell put options to buy ETFs at lower prices while collecting premium.\n\nExample:\n• Want to buy VOO, currently at $450\n\n• Sell 1 put option with $430 strike, 30 days out\n\n• Collect $150 premium\n\n• Set aside $43,000 cash (to buy 100 shares if assigned)\n\nOutcomes:\n• VOO stays above $430: Keep $150 premium, repeat next month\n\n• VOO drops below $430: Buy 100 shares at $430 (your target price)\n\nBest for: Buying ETFs at discounts while earning income waiting.\n\n⚠️ Options Warnings:\n\n• Requires 100-share lots (expensive for high-priced ETFs)\n\n• Can lose money quickly if you don't understand them\n\n• Adds complexity and time commitment\n\n• Most retail investors lose money trading options\n\n• Start with paper trading before using real money\n\nOnly use options if you've studied them extensively and understand the risks."

      "title": "🔄 Portfolio Rebalancing Strategies",
      "content": "Rebalancing maintains your target allocation and forces you to buy low, sell high.\n\n📅 Rebalancing Methods:\n\n1️⃣ Calendar Rebalancing:\n• Rebalance on a fixed schedule (annually, quarterly)\n\n• Simple, easy to remember\n\n• Ignores market conditions\n\nBest for: Most investors. Set it and forget it.\n\n2️⃣ Threshold Rebalancing:\n• Rebalance when any position drifts 5%+ from target\n\n• More responsive to market moves\n\n• Requires monitoring\n\nExample:\n• Target: 60% stocks, 40% bonds\n\n• Stocks rally to 68%: Rebalance\n\n• Stocks crash to 53%: Rebalance\n\nBest for: Active investors who check portfolios monthly.\n\n3️⃣ Hybrid Approach:\n• Check quarterly\n\n• Only rebalance if drift exceeds 5%\n\n• Combines both methods\n\nBest for: Most investors. Balances simplicity and responsiveness.\n\n💰 Tax-Efficient Rebalancing:\n\nIn taxable accounts, avoid selling winners (triggers capital gains tax):\n\n✅ Direct new contributions to underweight positions\n✅ Reinvest dividends into underweight positions\n✅ Harvest losses to offset necessary sales\n✅ Only sell in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401k)\n\nIn retirement accounts, rebalance freely (no tax consequences).\n\n🎯 Rebalancing Bonus:\n\nRebalancing forces you to buy low and sell high:\n• Stocks crash 30%: Rebalancing makes you buy more stocks (buy low)\n\n• Stocks rally 50%: Rebalancing makes you sell some stocks (sell high)\n\nThis disciplined approach beats emotional investing. Studies show rebalancing adds 0.5-1% annually to returns."

      "title": "🌍 Currency Hedging with ETFs",
      "content": "International ETFs expose you to currency risk. Currency-hedged ETFs eliminate this.\n\n💱 The Currency Risk:\n\nYou buy VXUS (international stocks):\n• Foreign stocks gain 10% in local currency\n\n• But the dollar strengthens 5% vs foreign currencies\n\n• Your return: Only 5% (10% - 5%)\n\nCurrency movements can add or subtract 5-15% from returns annually.\n\n🛡️ Currency-Hedged ETFs:\n\nThese ETFs hedge currency exposure:\n\n• HEDJ (Europe, hedged) vs VGK (Europe, unhedged)\n\n• DXJ (Japan, hedged) vs EWJ (Japan, unhedged)\n\n• DBEF (Developed markets, hedged) vs VEA (Developed markets, unhedged)\n\nHedged ETFs use currency forwards to eliminate currency risk.\n\n🎯 When to Hedge:\n\n✅ Hedge when:\n• Dollar is weak and expected to strengthen\n\n• You want pure stock returns without currency noise\n\n• Investing in countries with weak currencies\n\n❌ Don't hedge when:\n• Dollar is strong (currency diversification benefits you)\n\n• Long-term investor (currency evens out over decades)\n\n• Hedging costs are high (0.30-0.50% annually)\n\nFor most long-term investors, unhedged international ETFs are fine. Currency risk diversifies your portfolio."
