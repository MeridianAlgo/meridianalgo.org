    {
      "id": 1,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the primary advantage of ETFs over mutual funds?",
      "options": [
        "ETFs trade throughout the day like stocks",
        "ETFs have higher returns",
        "ETFs are guaranteed by the government",
        "ETFs never lose value"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "ETFs trade continuously during market hours at real-time prices, while mutual funds only trade once per day at the closing NAV. This gives ETFs flexibility for intraday trading, limit orders, and stop losses."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is considered an excellent expense ratio for a broad market index ETF?",
      "options": [
        "Under 0.10%",
        "Under 0.50%",
        "Under 1.00%",
        "Under 2.00%"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Excellent broad market ETFs have expense ratios under 0.10% (10 basis points). For example, VOO charges only 0.03% annually. Never pay more than 0.20% for a broad market index ETF."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds due to their unique creation/redemption process.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. ETFs use an 'in-kind' creation/redemption process that allows them to avoid triggering capital gains distributions. This makes them significantly more tax-efficient than mutual funds, which often distribute taxable gains to shareholders."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the recommended minimum Assets Under Management (AUM) for an ETF?",
      "options": [
        "Over $1 billion",
        "Over $100 million",
        "Over $10 million",
        "AUM doesn't matter"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "ETFs with over $100 million AUM are generally safe, though over $500 million is better. Small ETFs (under $100M) often close within 2-3 years, forcing you to sell and potentially triggering taxes. Larger AUM also means better liquidity and tighter spreads."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the 'bid-ask spread' in ETF trading?",
      "options": [
        "The difference between the buying price and selling price",
        "The annual fee charged by the ETF",
        "The difference between the ETF price and NAV",
        "The commission charged by your broker"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The bid-ask spread is the difference between what buyers are willing to pay (bid) and what sellers are asking (ask). A tight spread (under 0.05%) means lower trading costs. Wide spreads can cost you money on every trade."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the classic '3-fund portfolio' composition?",
      "options": [
        "US stocks, international stocks, and bonds",
        "Stocks, bonds, and gold",
        "Large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap stocks",
        "Technology, healthcare, and financial stocks"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The legendary 3-fund portfolio consists of: US Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), International Total Stock Market ETF (VXUS), and US Total Bond Market ETF (BND). This simple allocation beats 90% of complex strategies."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The traditional rule for bond allocation is: Bonds = Your Age.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. The traditional rule suggests your bond allocation should equal your age (e.g., age 40 = 40% bonds). The modern rule adjusts this to 'Age - 20' to account for longer lifespans and lower bond yields."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What percentage of your portfolio should sector and thematic ETFs represent?",
      "options": [
        "No more than 10-20%",
        "At least 50%",
        "100% for maximum returns",
        "They should be avoided entirely"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Sector and thematic ETFs should represent no more than 10-20% of your total portfolio. They're higher risk, higher cost, and often underperform broad market ETFs. Your core holdings (broad market ETFs) should be 70-80%+ of your portfolio."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is 'tax-loss harvesting'?",
      "options": [
        "Selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce taxes",
        "Avoiding taxes by not selling investments",
        "Moving investments to a tax-free account",
        "Donating investments to charity"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Tax-loss harvesting means selling investments at a loss to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill. You can then buy a similar (but not identical) ETF to maintain market exposure while harvesting the tax loss."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The 'wash sale rule' prevents you from buying the same security within 30 days of selling it at a loss.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. The wash sale rule disallows tax losses if you buy a 'substantially identical' security within 30 days before or after the sale. To avoid this, sell one ETF (e.g., VOO) and buy a similar but different ETF (e.g., IVV) that tracks the same index."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which account type is best for high-yield bonds and REITs?",
      "options": [
        "Tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401k)",
        "Taxable brokerage accounts",
        "Savings accounts",
        "It doesn't matter"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "High-yield bonds and REITs generate ordinary income taxed at your highest rate (up to 37%). Place them in tax-advantaged accounts (IRA, 401k) where you don't pay taxes on dividends and interest. Save taxable accounts for tax-efficient stock ETFs."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is 'dollar-cost averaging'?",
      "options": [
        "Investing a fixed amount regularly regardless of market conditions",
        "Buying only when prices are low",
        "Selling when prices are high",
        "Timing the market perfectly"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., $500/month) regardless of market conditions. When prices are high, you buy fewer shares; when prices are low, you buy more. This removes emotion and beats market timing attempts."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Rebalancing your portfolio forces you to buy low and sell high.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. When stocks crash, rebalancing makes you buy more stocks (buy low). When stocks rally, rebalancing makes you sell some stocks (sell high). This disciplined approach beats emotional investing and adds 0.5-1% annually to returns."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How often should most investors rebalance their portfolio?",
      "options": [
        "Once per year",
        "Daily",
        "Weekly",
        "Never"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Most investors should rebalance once per year or when any position drifts 5%+ from target. More frequent rebalancing increases costs and taxes without improving returns. Less frequent rebalancing allows too much drift from your target allocation."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a 'covered call' options strategy?",
      "options": [
        "Selling call options against ETF shares you own to generate income",
        "Buying call options to speculate on price increases",
        "Buying put options for downside protection",
        "Selling put options to acquire shares"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A covered call means you own 100 shares of an ETF and sell a call option against it, collecting premium income. This generates 0.5-1% monthly income but caps your upside at the strike price. Best for sideways or slightly bullish markets."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Leveraged ETFs (2x, 3x) are suitable for long-term buy-and-hold investors.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "False. Leveraged ETFs use derivatives and reset daily, making them unsuitable for long-term holding. They're designed for day traders. A 3x leveraged ETF can lose 90%+ of its value in a market crash. Beginners should avoid them entirely."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which ETF tracks the entire US stock market?",
      "options": [
        "VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)",
        "SPY (S&P 500 ETF)",
        "QQQ (Nasdaq 100 ETF)",
        "BND (Total Bond Market ETF)"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF) holds 3,500+ US stocks, covering the entire US market from large-cap to small-cap. SPY only holds the 500 largest companies, and QQQ holds 100 Nasdaq stocks. VTI provides the broadest US diversification."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is 'tracking error' in an ETF?",
      "options": [
        "How closely the ETF matches its benchmark index",
        "The bid-ask spread",
        "The expense ratio",
        "The number of holdings"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Tracking error measures how closely an ETF matches its benchmark index. If an S&P 500 ETF returns 9.5% when the S&P 500 returned 10%, the tracking error is 0.50%. Excellent ETFs have tracking error under 0.10% annually."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Thematic ETFs (clean energy, cannabis, space) typically have higher expense ratios than broad market ETFs.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "True. Thematic ETFs typically charge 0.50-0.95% expense ratios compared to 0.03-0.10% for broad market ETFs. They're also more volatile, concentrated, and often underperform. Use them sparingly (5-10% of portfolio max) and only with strong conviction."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What did Warren Buffett recommend for most investors?",
      "options": [
        "90% in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, 10% in short-term government bonds",
        "100% in individual stocks",
        "50% stocks, 50% bonds",
        "100% in gold"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Warren Buffett recommended putting 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund (like VOO) and 10% in short-term government bonds. He believes this simple strategy will beat most professional investors over the long term."
