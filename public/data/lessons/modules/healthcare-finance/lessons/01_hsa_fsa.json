        "title": "Understanding HSAs",
        "content": "A Health Savings Account is a tax-advantaged savings account available to individuals enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). For 2024, an HDHP is defined as a plan with a minimum deductible of $1,600 for individuals or $3,200 for families. HSAs offer unique triple tax benefits: contributions are tax-deductible, the money grows tax-free, and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are tax-free. Unlike FSAs, HSA funds roll over year to year, making them excellent long-term savings vehicles. You own your HSA even if you change jobs or health plans."

        "title": "Understanding FSAs",
        "content": "Flexible Spending Accounts are employer-sponsored benefit accounts that allow you to set aside pre-tax dollars for eligible healthcare expenses. The key difference from HSAs is that FSAs typically operate on a 'use it or lose it' basis—funds must be used within the plan year or you forfeit them. Some employers offer a grace period (up to 2.5 months) or allow you to carry over up to $610 into the next year. FSAs don't require enrollment in an HDHP and can be used alongside any health insurance plan. The 2024 contribution limit is $3,050."

        "content": "For 2024, HSA contribution limits are $4,150 for individuals and $8,300 for families, with an additional $1,000 catch-up contribution allowed for those 55 and older. To be eligible for an HSA, you must be enrolled in an HDHP, not be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, and not be enrolled in Medicare. FSA contribution limits are $3,050 for healthcare FSAs. You cannot contribute to both an HSA and a healthcare FSA in the same year, though you can have a limited-purpose FSA (for dental and vision only) alongside an HSA."

        "title": "Qualified Medical Expenses",
        "content": "Both HSAs and FSAs can be used for a wide range of qualified medical expenses as defined by the IRS. This includes doctor visits, prescription medications, dental care, vision care, mental health services, and medical equipment. Over-the-counter medications and menstrual products are also eligible. HSAs can even be used for COBRA premiums and long-term care insurance premiums. Keep all receipts for your records—with an HSA, you can reimburse yourself years later for expenses you paid out of pocket, as long as they occurred after you opened the account."

        "title": "Investment Strategies",
        "content": "One of HSA's most powerful features is the ability to invest your balance once it reaches a certain threshold (typically $1,000-$2,000). This transforms your HSA from a simple savings account into a retirement planning tool. Many financial experts recommend paying medical expenses out of pocket if you can afford it, allowing your HSA to grow tax-free for decades. After age 65, you can withdraw HSA funds for any purpose without penalty (though non-medical withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income), making it function like a traditional IRA with the added benefit of tax-free medical withdrawals."

        "title": "Common Mistakes to Avoid",
        "content": "Don't over-contribute to an FSA—carefully estimate your annual medical expenses to avoid forfeiting funds. With HSAs, avoid withdrawing funds for non-medical expenses before age 65, as you'll face a 20% penalty plus income tax. Keep detailed records of all medical expenses and HSA withdrawals for tax purposes. Don't assume you can't have an HSA if you're on Medicare—you can't contribute once enrolled, but you can still use existing funds. Finally, don't leave HSA funds sitting in cash if you don't need them immediately—invest for long-term growth."
