        "title": "Choosing Your Business Structure",
        "content": "Your business structure determines liability protection, tax treatment, and administrative requirements. Sole Proprietorship is the simplest—you and the business are one entity, but you have unlimited personal liability and pay self-employment tax on all profits. LLC (Limited Liability Company) provides liability protection (personal assets protected from business debts) with flexible tax treatment—can be taxed as sole proprietor, partnership, or corporation. S-Corporation offers liability protection and potential tax savings by allowing you to pay yourself a reasonable salary (subject to payroll taxes) and take remaining profits as distributions (not subject to self-employment tax). C-Corporation is for businesses seeking outside investment, with double taxation but easier to raise capital. Most small businesses start as sole proprietors or LLCs. Consider S-Corp election once profitable (typically $60,000+ net income) to save on self-employment taxes."

        "title": "Setting Up Business Banking",
        "content": "Open a dedicated business checking account immediately—even before making your first sale. This separates business and personal finances, which is legally required for LLCs and corporations, and essential for tax purposes and bookkeeping. To open a business account, you'll need: your business formation documents (LLC articles, incorporation papers), EIN (Employer Identification Number from the IRS), business license if required, and personal identification. Compare banks on fees, minimum balances, transaction limits, online banking features, and integration with accounting software. Consider online business banks (Novo, Relay, Mercury) for lower fees and better features. Many offer free accounts with no minimums. Also open a business savings account for tax savings and emergency funds—aim to save 3-6 months of operating expenses."

        "title": "Business Credit Cards and Credit",
        "content": "Business credit cards serve multiple purposes: separate business expenses, build business credit, earn rewards on business spending, and provide short-term cash flow flexibility. Apply for a business credit card once you have an EIN and business bank account. Initially, you'll likely need to personally guarantee the card, but it can still build business credit if the issuer reports to business credit bureaus (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business, Equifax Business). Look for cards with: no annual fee (or valuable benefits that justify the fee), rewards aligned with your spending (cash back, travel, office supplies), 0% intro APR for large purchases, and expense management tools. Pay the balance in full monthly to avoid interest. Strong business credit helps you qualify for better terms on loans, leases, and vendor credit lines."

        "title": "Getting an EIN and Business Licenses",
        "content": "An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is like a Social Security number for your business. It's free and takes minutes to get from the IRS website. You need an EIN if you: have employees, operate as a corporation or partnership, file certain tax returns, or want to open a business bank account (some banks accept SSN for sole proprietors, but EIN is better). Even sole proprietors benefit from an EIN—it keeps your SSN off business documents and helps separate business and personal identity. Business licenses and permits vary by location and industry. Check requirements at federal, state, and local levels. Common licenses: general business license, professional licenses, sales tax permit, health permits (for food businesses), and home occupation permits. Operating without required licenses risks fines and legal issues."

        "title": "Bookkeeping Basics",
        "content": "Proper bookkeeping tracks income and expenses, ensures tax compliance, and provides insights for business decisions. At minimum, track: all income (sales, payments received), all expenses (categorized by type), accounts receivable (money owed to you), accounts payable (money you owe), and inventory if applicable. Use accounting software (QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave, Xero) rather than spreadsheets—it's more accurate, easier for taxes, and provides better reports. Connect your business bank accounts and credit cards for automatic transaction import. Reconcile accounts monthly to catch errors. Save all receipts and invoices—digital is fine. Consider hiring a bookkeeper once revenue reaches $5,000-$10,000/month. Good bookkeeping makes tax preparation easier and cheaper, helps you understand profitability, and is required for loans or investors."

        "title": "Separating Business and Personal Finances",
        "content": "Never mix business and personal finances—it's the most common small business mistake. Use your business account exclusively for business transactions and personal accounts for personal expenses. If you need money from the business, take an official owner's draw or salary, don't just transfer randomly. Mixing finances: pierces the corporate veil (eliminates liability protection for LLCs/corporations), makes bookkeeping a nightmare, complicates taxes, and looks unprofessional to lenders and investors. If you accidentally use a personal card for business, reimburse yourself officially through the business account with proper documentation. If you use a business card for personal expenses, repay the business immediately. Maintain clear boundaries from day one—it's much harder to untangle later."

This can save thousands in self-employment taxes by allowing you to split income between salary (subject to payroll taxes) and distributions (not subject to self-employment tax). The savings often exceed the additional accounting costs."
