      "content": "Traditional savings accounts at big banks often pay 0.01% APY—essentially zero. Online banks and credit unions flipped the script with high-yield savings accounts (HYSA) that move with the interest rate environment. When inflation is elevated, parking cash in a HYSA reduces the erosion of purchasing power. You keep the flexibility of cash while earning meaningful interest."

      "content": "APY (annual percentage yield) factors in compounding. A $10,000 balance at 4.35% APY earns about $435 in a year without you lifting a finger. Contrast that with $1 at 0.01% and you start to understand the opportunity cost of ignoring HYSA. Even short-term savings like a vacation fund should live in an account that pays you back."

A healthy strategy uses HYSA as the default but ladders CDs for specific future expenses like tuition or a wedding. Treasury bills add government-backed security."
